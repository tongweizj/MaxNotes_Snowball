# Detailed tax information for your account

 Hi wei,                                                      

Tax time can be busy as you start organizing your required documentation to file your return, and you will probably have specific questions, depending on whether you have a Margin account or a registered account. 当您开始整理申报所需的文件时，税务时间可能会很忙，您可能会有具体的问题，这取决于您是否有一个保证金账户或注册账户。

For **Margin account** holders, at a high level here's what you can expect to receive at tax time: 对于**保证金账户**的持有者来说，在高层次上，以下是你在纳税时可以预期收到的东西。

- If you deposited money into your account or purchased securities, you will not receive a tax slip. The securities you've purchased will appear on a Trading Summary。如果您将钱存入您的账户或购买证券，您将不会收到税单。您所购买的证券将出现在交易摘要上，而您的交易摘要将显示在您的账户上。
- If securities you purchased paid income, like a dividend, we provide you with an Income Summary and tax slip based on your residency。如果您购买的证券有收入（如股息），我们会根据您的居住地向您提供收入摘要和税单。
- If you sold securities you previously purchased (including transferring them to a registered plan), we provide you with a Trading Summary and a T5008 tax slip. 如果您卖出了之前购买的证券（包括将证券转让给注册计划），我们会向您提供交易摘要和T5008税单。

For **registered account** holders, a tax slip can be generated if any of these activities occur, depending on the type of registered account: 对于**注册账户**持有人来说，如果发生任何上述活动，都可以生成税单，这取决于注册账户的类型。

- Contributions 缴款
- Withdrawals 提款
- Account income earned for U.S. persons from U.S. sources  美国人从美国来源赚取的账户收入

**Note**: if you have a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), you do **not** receive a tax slip (unless you are a U.S. person who has earned income on U.S.-sourced investments). 

**注**：如果你有一个免税储蓄账户（TFSA），你不会**收到税单（除非你是美国人，有来自美国的投资收入）。
